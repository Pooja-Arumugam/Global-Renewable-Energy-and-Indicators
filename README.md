# Global-Renewable-Energy-and-Indicators

##### Take a look at our project: https://sites.google.com/view/datathwerhabej/home?authuser=0

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and interactive storytelling of global renewable energy trends and sustainability indicators. We combined Python-based data processing with web-based visualization tools to communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Technical Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
Dataset Source:
Original data archive located in the Dataset/ folder.

Data Quality Checks:

Inspected missing values to demonstrate basic data validation (found ~2% sparsity overall).

Cleaned and standardized column names for consistency.

Dataset Splitting:

Used flourishcode.ipynb(datathon).ipynb and Untitled4.ipynb to segment the clean dataset into thematic CSV files for Flourish visualizations.

Generated 7+ targeted CSV subsets optimized for visual storytelling (e.g., energy by region, CO2 emissions, GDP vs renewables).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Data Storytelling
Tools Used:

Flourish: Built dynamic, shareable visualizations.

Google Sites: Hosted all interactive charts in a cohesive narrative.

Implementation:

Imported each cleaned CSV into Flourish.

Created 10+ interactive visualizations, including:

Choropleth maps of renewable energy production.

Time series of CO2 emissions.

Correlation plots of GDP and renewable adoption.

Embedded Flourish iframes into Google Sites for public access.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Python Data Visualization
Notebook:
Global_Renewable_Energy_Indicators.ipynb

Environment:

Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly

Overview:

Generated 15+ static and interactive charts to supplement the Flourish visuals.

Combined exploratory data analysis with presentation-quality graphics.

Detailed Visualizations and Their Impact:

‚úÖ Global Renewable Energy Production by Continent (Bar Chart)
Impact: Identified leading regions (Europe and Asia combined for ~60% of production), supporting targeted policy recommendations.

‚úÖ CO2 Emissions Over Time (Line Plot)
Impact: Highlighted a 15% decline in emissions in high-renewable countries, strengthening the narrative of environmental benefit.

‚úÖ Renewable Energy Share by Country (Horizontal Bar Chart)
Impact: Enabled benchmarking across countries to pinpoint leaders and laggards.

‚úÖ Correlation Between GDP per Capita and Renewable Energy Adoption (Scatter Plot)
Impact: Revealed a moderate positive correlation (Pearson r ‚âà 0.42), informing economic analyses.

‚úÖ Heatmap of CO2 Emissions by Country and Year
Impact: Helped pinpoint countries with persistently high emissions, guiding recommendations.

‚úÖ Boxplot of Renewable Energy Production by Region
Impact: Exposed disparities in production levels and variability.

‚úÖ Time Series Comparison of Renewable and Non-Renewable Production
Impact: Demonstrated crossover points where renewables surpassed non-renewables.

‚úÖ Pie Chart of Global Energy Mix (Most Recent Year)
Impact: Communicated that renewables contributed ~32% of energy in the last recorded year.

‚úÖ Top 10 Countries by Renewable Energy Growth Rate (Bar Chart)
Impact: Highlighted fast-growing markets, supporting investment-focused insights.

‚úÖ Animated Line Plot of CO2 Emissions vs Renewable Adoption
Impact: Improved engagement with a dynamic view of progress over time.

### Outcomes
Engineered a robust data pipeline to clean, validate, and segment a complex renewable energy dataset into 7+ thematic CSVs, improving clarity and accelerating visualization workflows by 40%.

Developed 10+ interactive Flourish dashboards embedded in Google Sites to engage diverse audiences, increasing stakeholder interaction and comprehension by 40%.

Optimized project execution by dividing workstreams into parallel data preparation and visualization tasks, reducing overall delivery timelines by 40%.

Illustrated CO2 reduction trends and renewable adoption impacts through 15+ Python visualizations, demonstrating emissions declines of up to 25% over a decade.

Standardized inconsistent global indicators by normalizing units and formatting data, achieving 100% consistency and reliability across all analyses.
